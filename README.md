Flappy Bird Game Project

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game Project! In this project, we are creating our very own Flappy Bird game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with HTML5 canvas. 
Here's a brief overview of what this project entails:

Project Overview

~ Create a Game Loop: Set up the core game loop to ensure smooth and continuous gameplay.
~ Design the Game Canvas: Utilize HTML5 canvas to draw game graphics, including the flappy bird and obstacles.
~ Implement User Interaction: Allow players to control the game by adding click handlers to make the bird jump.
~ Generate Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generate and move obstacles (pipes) across the screen to challenge the player.
~ Detect Collisions: Implement collision detection to determine when the flappy bird collides with obstacles, affecting gameplay.
~ Keep Score: Add a scoring system to track the player's progress and enhance competitiveness.

By the end of this project, we will have a fully functional Flappy Bird game.

Happy Gaming!
